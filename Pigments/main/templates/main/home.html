            <h2>About Our Project</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our project, inspired by the extensive collection of items donated to the Kerr Hamilton Institute by Roberson and Co. and other contributors. This collection serves as a comprehensive archive that vividly illustrates the manufacturing and painting industry of 19th-century England.
            Our primary goal is to bring various elements of this archive to light, with a special focus on pigments. The collection includes over 300 vials filled with a diverse array of pigments and materials.
            The purpose of this website is to showcase these elements, making them freely and easily accessible for exploration. We have created a digital edition of a manuscript where Charles Roberson and others documented their recipes for creating and composing pigments, as well as a database of many materials from the archive. This initiative is designed to be expandable, paving the way for future studies and discoveries in this fascinating field.</p>
